This project performs simple background replacement for an uploaded image using OpenCV. It separates the foreground using basic grayscale thresholding and overlays it on a new virtual background.

Features
Upload input and background images via Colab.
Automatically resizes background to match input dimensions.
Applies grayscale thresholding to extract the foreground.
Combines the extracted foreground with a virtual background.
Saves and displays the final output image.
Requirements
This notebook runs in Google Colab and uses the following Python libraries:

cv2 (OpenCV)
numpy
google.colab for file upload and image display
No installation is required in Colab as all dependencies come pre-installed.

Usage
Open the notebook in Google Colab.
Run the first cell to upload your images:
Upload one image for the subject.
Upload another image to be used as the virtual background.
Set the file paths in the script (or modify to auto-detect from uploaded.keys()).
Run the processing cells.
The output image will be displayed and saved as output_image_alternate.jpg.
Conclusion
This repository provides a simple and effective approach for background replacement using OpenCV in Google Colab. By utilizing basic image processing techniques such as grayscale conversion, thresholding, and bitwise operations, the script isolates the foreground from the original image and places it onto a new virtual background.

While this method works well for images with a clear contrast between the subject and background, it does have limitations in terms of accuracy, especially when dealing with complex backgrounds or challenging edge detection. For better results in such cases, we recommend exploring more advanced techniques, such as deep learning-based segmentation models (e.g., Mediapipe or U^2-Net).

Overall, this script provides a solid foundation for understanding image compositing and can be extended and improved for more robust real-world applications.
